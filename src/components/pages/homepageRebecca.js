                  My name Is Joshua Boss, and Iâ€™m a sophomore undergraduate student at Duke University, studying Computer science, Mathematics and Literature. I am interested in pursuing a career in either full stack software engineering or Product Management. I am particularly intrigued by projects and work centered on social equity issues and climate change. I created this webpage as a brief window into me, and an opportunity to improve my react, javascript, html, css, and general front-end development skills. Feel free to check out the other pages to learn more about me. Thanks for visiting!
